Cryptid supports encrypted sync functionality between a local filesystem and Backblaze's B2 service.

Features:

- A random keyfile is encrypted with a passphrase to allow passphrases to be changed
without re-encrypting data.
- Because B2 does not support renames or alterations of metadata for uploaded files, we
use dedicated, overwritable metadata files to support renames.  This also allows for
bulk offloaded backups.  One use case is to support users with low upload bandwidth
staging subsets of files to their laptop, where they can use, eg, a library's high
bandwidth connection for the upload.

Limitations:
- File lengths are observable.  Preventing this would require block-based uploads.
- Fixed parallelism for uploads.  Because we upload small files first, bandwidth
saturation initially requires many more threads than when we get to large files
later on.
- No compression prior to encryption (makes efficient length calculation difficult)
- I am not a cryptographer, use at your own risk.

TODO:
- Clean up config.properties defaulting
- Manifest file to avoid having to scan everything in remote

MAYBEs:
- Block based storage option
- Compress prior to upload
